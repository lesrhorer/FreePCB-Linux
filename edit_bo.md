When the line is already drawn, you can edit its thickness, the hatching pattern as well as the layer. For the menu to appear, select the side of the line.

* F1 - Setting the line width, as well as the choice: area or line (closed or open)
* F2 - segment shape: straight or arc
* F3 - add new vertex
* F4 - Copying cutout, if any, for closed polylines (added since 2-033 version)
* F5 - Select contour. If you want to copy a line, you must use this function before copying, and then copy (ctrl+c ctrl+v)
* F6 - Change the layer and hatching pattern if the line is closed (area)
* F7 - Add a cutout to the polyline. Used when the polyline is an area with a full hatch pattern.
* F8 - delete polyline
* F9 - selection of all elements located inside the polyline contour. It is useful when you have for example a panel of printed circuit boards, and you need to select a printed circuit board among many printed circuit boards that have a complex shape of the contour line.
