**Clearance between sides**

Often between the sides of the polygons of different nets you need to set a certain clearance. As well as when setting the clearance for trace segments, here you must first click on the movable side, and then click on the non-movable side, i.e. select two sides of the area while holding the `CTRL` button. And then use the `F1_Set_Clearance` button.

The clearance value is shown in the status bar at the bottom of the program window. You can then change the clearance by pressing the `F2 F3` buttons. The modified clearance value will be stored in FreePcb-2 memory until you press the file save button at the top left.
