### `Printing Highlighted Objects`

FreePcb uses gerber layers for printing. If you select circuit board objects before creating gerber files and then generate gerber files, the layer `highlight.gbr` will be added to the main layer files. After loading the files into the viewer, the highlight layer will need to be placed in the foreground/background. Thus, the selected objects will be displayed when printing.
