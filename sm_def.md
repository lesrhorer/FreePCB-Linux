### `Swell pad for solder mask`

Usually a solder mask for the pads is chosen a little more than the pads themselves by a certain amount.

1) Select the part of interest on the board (left click)
2) Press F2-Edit Footprint
3) Then select the pad in the footprint editor
4) Press F1-Edit Pad, a dialog box will open
