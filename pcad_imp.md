### Import P-CAD ASCII Files

For successful import into FreePcb-2 format, if possible, prepare the imported file.

* Move the design in the P-cad closer to the origin at the lower left edge of the board so that the maximum coordinate of any objects is no more than 600mm (~ 23600mil)

* RefDes must not contain a dot character.

* Inverse inner layers will be converted to FreePcb-2 signal layers.

From the right-click menu of the Infobox window, select the Import P-cad menu item, select the path to the file, and then click OK
