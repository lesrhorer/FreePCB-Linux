### How to add a polyline?

![](pictures/add_line2.png)

Press `F3 (ADD_POLYLINE)`. In this dialog box, the initialized polyline width is taken from the previous selected polyline side. When you simply click on a polyline side, FreePcb-2 remembers its width. Then, when you open this dialog box, that same width value will show by default. If you want to create a non-closed polyline, select the `OPEN` type; if you want to draw a filled area, check the `CLOSED` checkbox.
