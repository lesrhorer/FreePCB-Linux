You can highlight the pins and the tops of the tracks that are in contact with the copper region, for example, to check the connection point of the shielding copper region, which usually connects at one or several points and you cannot allow its connection anywhere. For such zones there is a function button `F6 Contact Test`. When the side of the copper area is highlighted, press and hold this button, and the pins and vertices will be highlighted.
