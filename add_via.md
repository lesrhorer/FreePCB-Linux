# How to add via?

To add a via to the top of the road segment, you need to select the top and press the `'F'` key. If the project options have several different sizes of vias, pressing the `'F'` again will set the next size. To remove a via from the top of the road segment, click on `'U'`. To add a free via hole, add a part that contains a single pin with via hole parameters. Leave the Package attribute field empty.
