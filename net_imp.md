`Import PADS-PCB netlist`

Import procedure has not changed.

A detailed description can be found in the Freepcb-1.359 manual ([download](https://github.com/Duxah/FreePCB-2/raw/master/FreePcb-2/bin/doc/freepcb_user_guide.pdf)).

In the menu, the import button may not be active if the netlist is protected. You can remove protection through the main menu Project -> Nets -> Netlist protected.

`Export PADS-PCB netlist`

Netlist is exported automatically to the `project folder \ cookies \ filename.net` when the file is saved.
